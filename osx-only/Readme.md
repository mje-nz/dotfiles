# macOS Setup


## Applications
Most of these are installed through [Homebrew](brew.sh).
Those that are installed through the Mac App Store are marked with an :apple: and those that are installed manually are marked with a :raised_hand:.

Applications I use all the time:

* [1Password](https://1password.com/) for passwords
* [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) for opening files (although I'm not convinced it's better than Spotlight)
* [Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com/) :raised_hand: for organising menu bar icons
* [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) for syncing files between computers
* [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/) for adjusting colour temperature at night

* [The Unarchiver](https://theunarchiver.com) for unzipping formats Archive Utility doesn't support

QuickLook plugins:
