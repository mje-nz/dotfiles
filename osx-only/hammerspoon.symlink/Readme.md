# Hammerspoon config

* Remap Caps Lock to Control (when held) and Escape (when pressed)
* Switch to and from the network and audio adaptors on my Thunderbolt dock automatically
* Mute speakers when waking from sleep
* Mute speakers when leaving home WiFi

The keyboard remapping requires Hammerspoon to be enabled in `System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility`, and Caps Lock to be mapped to Control in `System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard > Modifier Keys`.
