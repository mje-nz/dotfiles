## History expansion
# To insert arguments from the previous command anywhere in a command:
!*    # all the arguments
!^    # the first argument
!$    # the last argument
# Press tab or enter to expand.  See also `cheat readline`.

# The full syntax for history expansion is:
#   ![event designator][word designator][modifiers]
# Event designators let you refer to a history item other than the previous
# command, e.g.:
!-n   # the current command minus n
!str  # the most recent command starting with str
# Word designators indicate which part of the command to include.  A ":" is
# required after the event designator unless the word designator begins with
# one of "^$*-%". Word designators include:
0     # the first input word (the command)
n     # the nth argument
^     # the first argument (same as 1)
$     # the last argument
x-y   # a range of words; x defaults to 0
*     # all the arguments, or a null value if there are none
x*    # abbreviates ‘x-$’
x-    # like ‘x*’ but omitting word $.
# Modifiers do things like turn filenames in to absolute paths, convert an
# argument to lowercase, perform substituts etc, but you'll probably never
# use them.
