# To create a symlink:
ln -s path/to/the/target/directory name-of-symlink

# The target is any string (non-empty, no null characters), and  will be
# interpreted as a path relative to the symlink name (or an absolute path).
# If the symlink name is a directory and it exists, the symlink will be placed
# inside it.

# Symlink, while overwriting existing destination files
ln -sf /some/dir/exec /usr/bin/exec
